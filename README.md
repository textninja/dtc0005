# Daily Tech Challenge #5
## Build a custom TextInput using React Native

For this challenge, I enhanced a TextInput such as to format dollar amounts
automatically. I tried a few different approaches, but the one I settled on uses
a Touchable container with flex direction set to row, and a handful of text
inputs inside. 

It was only ever meant to work in iOS. As a daily challenge, it doesn't look
good in the best of times, but it will look especially shoddy on platforms other
than iOS.
